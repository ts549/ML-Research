CNN Research done in July 2021

CNN:
- The idea is that the pixels of an image will be flattened into one layer and assign one pixel to a neuron
- This gets intensive for high pixel images like 7000 x 8000
- Need to use ConvNet filters to simplify images while keeping important features
- Makes the flattening layer much less power consuming
- Use Conv layers, dropout, pooling, downsampling, etc.
    - First Conv Layer captures low-level
- Padding
    - Valid padding
        - Increases dimensionality
    - Same padding
        - Dimensionality remains the same
- Pooling Layer
    - Extracts dominant features and works well with rotational and positional invariant features
    - Max pooling and average pooling
    - Takes max of every n x n pixels
    - Pooling
        - Downsampling operation
        - Downsampling helps with recognizing images that are oriented differently
- Max Pooling
    - Noise Suppressant
- Softmax Classification
- Takes feature map of a picture using filters
    - Generates a good reference of image
- Applies non-linearity activation function (usually ReLU)
    - Negatives go to 0
    - Positive stays the same
